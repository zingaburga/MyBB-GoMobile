Some changes made by me (zingaburga) make it not possible to directly use this newer version of GoMobile without some sort of upgrade process.
As the original GoMobile was in beta stage, I will not bother providing an upgrade script to migrate changes - rather, I will recommend you to uninstall the plugin (including removing the theme) before installing this version.

However, if you wish to try to manually migrate changes over, here's a list of upgrades required:
- 'gomobile' DB table has been removed and replaced with a simple textarea setting - you will need to migrate your entries over to this setting
